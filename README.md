# Spotify Guessing Game
A game where you test how well you know your music. After signing in to Spotify and configuring the app, choose your playlist and output device to begin the game. It will play a 
random track at a random position from the playlist for two seconds. You have six multiple choice options. There are four options regarding the playback of the track. Replay will 
play the same snippet again, with a penalty of 5 points. Extend and replay will play the previous snippet with an extra two seconds after - penalty of 15 points. New Slice will 
play a different part of the track with a penalty of 15 points. Next track will skip the current track, however your penalties will carry over to the next track!
